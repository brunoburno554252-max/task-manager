Kanban v6 test results: Click on card works - detail panel opens with task info, pipeline buttons (Pendente/Em Andamento/Concluída), responsible info, due date, comments tab, activities tab. The click detection is working correctly now. Need to verify drag still works too. The MouseSensor with distance:10 should allow clicks under 10px movement and start drag after 10px.
