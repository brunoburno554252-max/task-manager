Kanban Premium Screenshot Review:
- Three columns visible: Pendente (0), Em Andamento (4), Concluída (0)
- Column headers have gradient icons (orange/blue/green) - looking great
- Cards have left priority accent bar (orange for high, red for urgent)
- Cards show: title, description, priority badge, assignee avatar with initials, task ID
- Avatar gradient circles with initials visible (TB for Triệu)
- "Não atribuído" shown with dashed circle for unassigned tasks
- Empty columns show icons and text (Nenhuma tarefa pendente, Arraste tarefas aqui)
- Header has Kanban Board title with target icon, task counter, Filtros button, Nova Tarefa button
- Overall design is significantly more premium and elaborate than before
- The cards are much more detailed with multiple visual indicators
