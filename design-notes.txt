Kanban screenshot review:
- Three columns: Pendente, Em Andamento, Concluída - working correctly
- Task cards showing title, description, priority badge, assignee
- "Nova Tarefa" button visible in top right
- Each column has add button
- Dark theme consistent with dashboard
- Cards have subtle borders and hover effects
- Overall Kanban looks clean and functional
- Need to run tests and verify everything works
